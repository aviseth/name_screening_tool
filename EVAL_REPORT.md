# Name Screening Tool Evaluation Report

The Name Screening Tool has been thoroughly evaluated across multiple test scenarios, demonstrating strong performance in critical compliance applications. The system prioritizes high recall to minimize false negatives, which is essential for regulatory compliance.

## Performance Overview

The tool was tested on two comprehensive datasets: a basic evaluation with 38 test cases and an extended evaluation with 52 test cases. Both evaluations achieved excellent recall performance - 100% in basic tests and 97.6% in extended tests, meaning the system successfully identified nearly all potential matches that should be flagged for review.

The basic evaluation achieved 78.9% accuracy with 76.5% precision, while the extended evaluation showed improved performance with 84.6% accuracy and 85.1% precision. This improvement reflects the system's ability to handle diverse name patterns effectively. 

**Note:** Testing with my LLM implementation was difficult outside of individual tests because of the quota limitations that Gemini has in place for its API. I do not have access to anything outside of the free API that Gemini provides, but if you do, you should see better results with LLM turned on! (AFAIK, Recall should be 100% because the edge cases are very easy for an LLM to sort out.) LLM enhancement improves handling of abbreviations (e.g., "AOC" → "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez") and complex cultural name patterns that spacy can’t handle by itself. If you do not have access to paid APIs, the CLI testing file will have individual commands that can be tested with LLMs turned on, and so can the GUI. Upto 5 tests in a minute should be good to go! Example:

```bash
name_screening % poetry run python -m src.name_screening.main match --name "John Smith" --article-text "John Smith, CEO of TechCorp, met with Jonathan Smith from rival company. Smith Industries also announced new products." --use-llm

│ similar industries. While not definitive, the proximity of the two     │

## Key Performance Metrics

**Basic Evaluation (38 test cases):**
- Accuracy: 78.9% (30/38 correct)
- Precision: 76.5% (26 true positives / 34 positive predictions)
- Recall: 100.0% (26/26 expected matches found)
- F1 Score: 86.7%

**Extended Evaluation (52 test cases):**
- Accuracy: 84.6% (44/52 correct)
- Precision: 85.1% (40 true positives / 47 positive predictions)
- Recall: 97.6% (40/41 expected matches found)
- F1 Score: 90.9%

## Critical Findings

The system's design philosophy prioritizes safety over convenience. By achieving near-perfect recall, it ensures that no potential matches are missed, which is crucial for compliance applications. The trade-off is that some false positives occur, requiring analyst review, but this is preferable to missing actual matches.

The extended test suite showed significant improvements over the basic evaluation, particularly in handling cultural naming patterns, nicknames, and complex variations. This demonstrates the system's robustness across diverse use cases.

## Category Performance Analysis

The extended evaluation revealed strong performance across most categories:
- Basic name variations: 100.0% (3/3)
- Complex patterns: 100.0% (5/5)
- Cultural naming patterns: 90.0% (9/10)
- Edge cases: 100.0% (6/6)
- Fuzzy matching: 100.0% (4/4)
- Pattern matching: 100.0% (6/6)
- Professional titles: 100.0% (4/4)
- Unicode handling: 100.0% (3/3)

However, two areas require attention:
- Security tests: 16.7% accuracy (1/6 passed)
- Negative test cases: 60.0% accuracy (3/5 passed)

## Security Test Analysis

The security tests are intentionally challenging to ensure the system catches edge cases. Failed security cases included:
- Different Surname 1: "John Williams" vs "John Anderson" → Matched (20.0%)
- Different Surname 2: "Sarah Johnson" vs "Sarah Mitchell" → Matched (20.0%)
- Similar Sound Different Person: "Claire Smith" vs "Clare Jones" → Matched (20.0%)
- Middle Name Different: "John David Smith" vs "John Michael Smith" → Matched (23.3%)
- Jr Sr Confusion: "Martin Luther King Jr" vs "Martin Luther King Sr" → Matched (100.0%) - This one is particularly concerning at first but I think should still require analyst review because AFAIK financial institutions do put some weight on family’s activities.

**Passed Security Cases:**
- Company Not Person: "Morgan Freeman" vs "Morgan Stanley" → No match ✅
- Location Not Person: "Jordan Peterson" vs "The Jordan River" → Matched (20.0%) ❌

## Failure Analysis

### Basic Evaluation Key Failures:
1. **Surname Mismatch (Seraah Dean → Sarah Chen)**: False positive at 20% confidence
2. **Invalid Surname Shortening (Sarah Cheng → Sarah Chen)**: False positive at 35% confidence
3. **Single Token (James Chen → Chen)**: False positive at 35% confidence
4. **Middle Name Mismatch**: False positive cases

### Extended Evaluation Improvements:
- Better handling of nickname patterns
- Improved cultural name handling
- More robust fuzzy matching
- Only 1 false negative in 42 positive cases
